We came together to create an open database of experience sampling datasets primarily from psychological research. Our goal is to provide easy access to experience sampling datasets, standardize metadata across studies, and enable researchers to find relevant datasets through filtering and search.

## What is openESM?
More details on the datasets, metadata, and technical details can be found in the [Documentation]({{< relref "docs/" >}}).

## How did we create openESM?

More details are available in our [introduction paper](TODO).

## Your resposibility
While we only include datasets that are openly available, it is your responsibility to ensure that you comply with the terms of use of each dataset. This includes checking for the license information of every dataset you use, as well as ensuring that you have the right to use the data for your intended purpose. We do not take responsibility for any misuse of the datasets or any legal issues that may arise from their use.
If you use our datasets in your research, please cite the original authors and the OpenESM database. You can find the citation information on each dataset's page. You can cite the OpenESM database using our introduction paper:
